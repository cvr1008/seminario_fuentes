Demand for animal protein is rising globally and has been facilitated by the 
expansion of intensive farming. However, intensive animal production relies on 
the regular use of antimicrobials to maintain health and productivity on farms. 
The routine use of antimicrobials fuels the development of antimicrobial 
resistance, a growing threat for the health of humans and animals. Monitoring 
global trends in antimicrobial use is essential to track progress associated 
with antimicrobial stewardship efforts across regions. We collected 
antimicrobial sales data for chicken, cattle, and pig systems in 41 countries in 
2017 and projected global antimicrobial consumption from 2017 to 2030. We used 
multivariate regression models and estimated global antimicrobial sales in 2017 
at 93,309 tonnes (95% CI: 64,443, 149,886). Globally, sales are expected to rise 
by 11.5% in 2030 to 104,079 tonnes (95% CI: 69,062, 172,711). All continents are 
expected to increase their antimicrobial use. Our results show lower global 
antimicrobial sales in 2030 compared to previous estimates, owing to recent 
reports of decrease in antimicrobial use, in particular in China, the world's 
largest consumer. Countries exporting a large proportion of their production are 
more likely to report their antimicrobial sales data than countries with small 
export markets.
