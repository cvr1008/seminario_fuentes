ABSTRACT = {Demand for animal protein is rising globally and has been facilitated by the expansion of intensive farming. However, intensive animal production relies on the regular use of antimicrobials to maintain health and productivity on farms. The routine use of antimicrobials fuels the development of antimicrobial resistance, a growing threat for the health of humans and animals. Monitoring global trends in antimicrobial use is essential to track progress associated with antimicrobial stewardship efforts across regions. We collected antimicrobial sales data for chicken, cattle, and pig systems in 41 countries in 2017 and projected global antimicrobial consumption from 2017 to 2030. We used multivariate regression models and estimated global antimicrobial sales in 2017 at 93,309 tonnes (95% CI: 64,443, 149,886). Globally, sales are expected to rise by 11.5% in 2030 to 104,079 tonnes (95% CI: 69,062, 172,711). All continents are expected to increase their antimicrobial use. Our results show lower global antimicrobial sales in 2030 compared to previous estimates, owing to recent reports of decrease in antimicrobial use, in particular in China, the world’s largest consumer. Countries exporting a large proportion of their production are more likely to report their antimicrobial sales data than countries with small export markets.},

    abstract = {Use of antimicrobials in farming has enabled the growth of intensive animal production and helped in meeting the global increase in demand for animal protein. However, the widespread use of veterinary antimicrobials drives antimicrobial resistance, with important consequences for animal health, and potentially human health. Global monitoring of antimicrobial use is essential: first, to track progress in reducing the reliance of farming on antimicrobials. Second, to identify countries where antimicrobial-stewardship efforts should be targeted to curb antimicrobial resistance. Data on usage of antimicrobials in food animals were collected from 42 countries. Multivariate regression models were used in combination with projections of animal counts for cattle, sheep, chicken, and pigs from the Food and Agriculture Organization to estimate global antimicrobial usage of veterinary antimicrobials in 2020 and 2030. Maps of animal densities were used to identify geographic hotspots of antimicrobial use. In each country, estimates of antimicrobial use (tonnes) were calibrated to match continental-level reports of antimicrobial use intensity (milligrams per kilogram of animal) from the World Organization for Animal Health, as well as country-level reports of antimicrobial use from countries that made this information publicly available. Globally, antimicrobial usage was estimated at 99,502 tonnes (95% CI 68,535–198,052) in 2020 and is projected, based on current trends, to increase by 8.0% to 107,472 tonnes (95% CI: 75,927–202,661) by 2030. Hotspots of antimicrobial use were overwhelmingly in Asia (67%), while <1% were in Africa. Findings indicate higher global antimicrobial usage in 2030 compared to prior projections that used data from 2017; this is likely associated with an upward revision of antimicrobial use in Asia/Oceania (~6,000 tonnes) and the Americas (~4,000 tonnes). National-level reporting of antimicrobial use should be encouraged to better evaluate the impact of national policies on antimicrobial use levels.},

abstract = {Livestock farming substantially contributes to the global economy and food security. However, it poses crucial environmental, animal welfare, and public health challenges. The main objective of this study is to quantify the global antimicrobial use (AMU) in cattle, chicken, and pig farming. This information is important for understanding the potential impact of farm AMU on the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance among animals and humans. Using the United States Department of Agriculture Production, Supply, and Distribution and the Food and Agriculture Organization databases, we estimated the total supply of cattle (in heads) and its distribution into four weight categories: calves (26%), cows (41%), heifers (4%), and bulls of more than one year (29%). Similarly, we calculated the total supply of pigs (in heads) and divided it into two weight categories: pigs (96%) and sows (4%). For chickens, we considered one weight category. We attributed to each category a standard weight according to the parameters set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to determine the animal biomass at risk of antimicrobial treatment, or population correction unit (PCU). Finally, we estimated the global PCUs and then the global AMU based on the average administered to the three species (in mg of active ingredients per kg PCU). With this method, we estimated a global annual AMU of 76 060 tonnes of antimicrobial active ingredients (2019–2021 average), of which 40 697 tonnes (or 53.5%) for cattle, 4 243 tonnes (or 5.6%) for chickens, and 31 120 tonnes (or 40.9%) for pigs. According to our assessment, global AMU leads to almost 20 000 tonnes less than the previous estimates due to a different evaluation of PCUs. In previous studies, PCUs were calculated on the liveweight at slaughtering of animals, while our method considers the age and sex of animals and their average weight at treatment. Our results are consistent with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) estimate of 76 704 tonnes of veterinary antimicrobials globally consumed in 2018 for the total of food-producing animals (the WOAH estimation is based on sales and import data).}
